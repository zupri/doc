NAME
       fsck - check and repair a Linux filesystem

SYNOPSIS
       fsck [-lsAVRTMNP] [-r [fd]] [-C [fd]] [-t fstype] [filesystem...] [--] [fs-specific-options]

DESCRIPTION
       fsck  is  used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux filesystems.  filesys can be a
       device name (e.g.  /dev/hdc1, /dev/sdb2), a mount point (e.g.  /, /usr,  /home),  or  an  ext2
       label or UUID specifier (e.g.  UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or LABEL=root).  Nor‐
       mally, the fsck program will try to handle filesystems on different physical  disk  drives  in
       parallel to reduce the total amount of time needed to check all of them.

       If  no filesystems are specified on the command line, and the -A option is not specified, fsck
       will default to checking filesystems in /etc/fstab serially.  This is equivalent  to  the  -As
       options.

       The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following conditions:

              0      No errors
              1      Filesystem errors corrected
              2      System should be rebooted
              4      Filesystem errors left uncorrected
              8      Operational error
              16     Usage or syntax error
              32     Checking canceled by user request
              128    Shared-library error

       The  exit  code  returned when multiple filesystems are checked is the bit-wise OR of the exit
       codes for each filesystem that is checked.

       In actuality, fsck is simply a front-end for the  various  filesystem  checkers  (fsck.fstype)
       available  under  Linux.  The filesystem-specific checker is searched for in the PATH environ‐
       ment variable. If the PATH is undefined then fallback to "/sbin".

       Please see the filesystem-specific checker manual pages for further details.

OPTIONS
       -l     Create an exclusive  flock(2)  lock  file  (/run/fsck/<diskname>.lock)  for  whole-disk
              device.   This  option  can be used with one device only (this means that -A and -l are
              mutually exclusive).  This option is recommended when more fsck(8) instances  are  exe‐
              cuted  in  the  same time.  The option is ignored when used for multiple devices or for
              non-rotating disks.  fsck does not lock  underlying  devices  when  executed  to  check
              stacked devices (e.g. MD or DM) – this feature is not implemented yet.

       -r [fd]
              Report  certain  statistics  for each fsck when it completes.  These statistics include
              the exit status, the maximum run set size (in kilobytes), the  elapsed  all-clock  time
              and the user and system CPU time used by the fsck run.  For example:

              /dev/sda1: status 0, rss 92828, real 4.002804, user 2.677592, sys 0.86186

              GUI  front-ends may specify a file descriptor fd, in which case the progress bar infor‐
              mation will be sent to that file descriptor in a machine parseable format.   For  exam‐
              ple:

              /dev/sda1 0 92828 4.002804 2.677592 0.86186
