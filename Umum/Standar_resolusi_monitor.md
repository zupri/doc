| CIF             | 352 x 288         | 4:3 (**)           | 99.0 k     | Common Intermediate Format - Standard resolution for video conferencing systems to convert from PAL to NTSC or vice versa. Width and Height is a multiple of 16 to simplify the MPEG encoding (full image can be divided into 16x16 MPEG macroblocks).                                                                                                        | 
| NTSC (DV)       | 720 x 480         | 4:3 (**) 16:9 (**) | 338 k      | NTSC is a composite video standard, mainly used in US, Canada, Japan and South Korea. DV is a standard resolution for digital video recording in consumer products according NTSC standard. The DV resolution uses a multiple of 16 for width and height to simplify the MPEG encoding. Thus the number of lines is reduced from 486 to 480 compared with D1. |
| NTSC (D1)       | 720 x 486         | 4:3 (**) 16:9 (**) | 342 k      | NTSC is a composite video standard, mainly used in US, Canada, Japan and South Korea. D1 is a standard resolution (defined by SMPTE group) for professional video recording with NTSC standard.                                                                                                                                                               | 
| NTSC (4:3)      | 720 x 540         | 4:03               | 380 k      | Necessary resolution to display NTSC (D1/DV) video in 4:3 format by using square pixel. Alternatively, 640 x 480 are used to display NTSC video.                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 
| PAL (D1/DV)     | 720 x 576         | 4:3 (**) 16:9 (**) | 405 k      | PAL is a composite video standard similar to NTSC, mainly used in Europe, Asia and Australia. Since the width and the height of the PAL resolution is a multiple of 16, there is no difference between D1 and DV format.                                                                                                                                      |
